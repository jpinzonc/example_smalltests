# Example, small tests, and stakoverflow solutions

## PURPOSE

Keep track of code that I created for small action in one of my other projects or random activities as well as code from answers to questions in Stackoverflow. 

## DESCRIPTION
Files can vary depending on the code and reason for their existance. Most of them should be R of Python Scripts, but I will be adding other languagues and other functions as necesary.
