# Example, small tests, and stakoverflow solutions

## PURPOSE

Keep files where I have created code for a particular small, sometimes unrelated, action in one of my other projects or random activity as well as code from answers to questions in stackoverflow. 

## DESCRIPTION
Files can vary depending on the code and reason for their existance. Most of them should be R of Python Scripts, but I will be adding other languagues and other functions as necesary.
